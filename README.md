# N-Layer Architecture

In software engineering N-Layer architecture is a clientâ€“server architecture in which presentation, application processing and data management functions are physically separated. The most widespread use of multitier architecture is the **three-tier/layer architecture**.

N-layer application architecture provides a model by which developers can create flexible and reusable applications. By segregating an application into layers, developers acquire the option of modifying or adding a specific layer, instead of reworking the entire application. A three-layer architecture is typically composed of a **presentation layer**, a **logic (Services) layer**, and a **data layer**.

While the concepts of **layer** and **tier** are often used interchangeably, one fairly common point of view is that there is indeed a difference. This view holds that a **layer is a logical structuring mechanism for the conceptual elements that make up the software solution**, while a **tier is a physical structuring mechanism for the hardware elements that make up the system infrastructure**.

## Layers

- Presentation layer (a.k.a. UI layer, view layer, presentation tier in multitier architecture)
- Business layer (a.k.a. business logic layer (BLL), domain logic layer)
- Data access layer (a.k.a. persistence layer, logging, networking, and other services which are required to support a particular business layer)
